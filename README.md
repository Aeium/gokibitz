GoKibitz: Move-by-move conversations about go games
===================================================

GoKibitz is a web app that lets users upload and review kifu (go game records in [sgf](http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/) format) and leave comments on individual moves.

I developed this app because I found it frustrating to try to comment on games other players would post for review: instructions like "on move 140, black should consider e14..." are frustrating to write and to read.

GoKibitz solves the per-move comment issue pretty well, but it doesn't yet solve the need to be able to suggest variations in an easy to read and understand way. Hopefully I can address that in the future.

License
=======
GoKibitz is free to all users, and its code is [open source](blob/master/LICENSE).

Feature Requests
================
[Feature requests](https://github.com/neagle/gokibitz/issues) are welcome! Timely delivery is, of course, not guaranteed. But knowing what people would like to see is very helpful.

Bugs
====

I'm grateful for [any and all bug submissions](https://github.com/neagle/gokibitz/issues). GoKibitz is in alpha, and I expect a lot of them.

Please have patience with me, though: I'm a one-father development shop, which means most coding gets done during naps and after bedtime.

Support
=======

There are two ways you can support development of GoKibitz:

1. [Feedback](mailto:nate@nateeagle.com)! I wrote this to help go players. If you use GoKibitz and tell me so, it's great encouragement to keep plugging away at features and bugs.
2. Pull Requests: it's asking a lot to ask other developers to dive into your code and contribute, but if anyone feels especially generous, I'd welcome collaboration.

(If you'd like to contribute, let me know: I can put together contribution guidelines to help you get set up to develop locally.)
